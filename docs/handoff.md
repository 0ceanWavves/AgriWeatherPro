4. Fixed database connection handling

For a detailed list of changes, see [CHANGELOG.md](../CHANGELOG.md).

## Architecture Overview

### Frontend

The frontend is built with React.js using functional components and hooks. The application follows a modular architecture with clear separation of concerns:

- **Components**: Reusable UI components
- **Pages**: Page-level components
- **Contexts**: React context providers for state management
- **Services**: Service layer for data operations
- **Utils**: Utility functions

### Backend

The backend is powered by Supabase, which provides:

- **Authentication**: User registration and login
- **Database**: PostgreSQL database for storing user data and preferences
- **Functions**: Serverless functions for backend logic

### Data Flow

1. User authenticates via Supabase Auth
2. Weather data is fetched from OpenWeatherMap API
3. Data is processed and transformed in the service layer
4. UI components render the processed data
5. User interactions trigger state updates and API calls

## Key Components

### Weather Forecast

The weather forecast functionality is implemented in:

- `src/components/WeatherForecast.js`: Main component for displaying weather forecasts
- `src/services/weatherService.js`: Service for fetching and processing weather data
- `src/utils/weatherUtils.js`: Utility functions for weather data calculations

### Crop Yield Predictions

The crop yield prediction functionality is implemented in:

- `src/components/CropYieldDisplay.js`: Component for displaying crop yield predictions
- `src/utils/simulationUtils.js`: Utility functions for crop growth simulations

### Authentication

Authentication is handled by:

- `src/contexts/AuthContext.js`: Context provider for authentication state
- `src/pages/Auth/`: Authentication-related pages
- `src/components/ProtectedRoute/`: Route protection component

## Known Issues

1. **Offline Mode**: The offline functionality needs improvement
2. **Mobile Responsiveness**: Some complex visualizations need better mobile support
3. **Error Handling**: API failure handling could be more comprehensive

## Future Roadmap

1. **Enhanced Analytics**: Add more advanced agricultural analytics
2. **Offline Support**: Improve offline functionality with better caching
3. **Mobile App**: Develop a native mobile application
4. **Integration**: Add integration with farm management systems
